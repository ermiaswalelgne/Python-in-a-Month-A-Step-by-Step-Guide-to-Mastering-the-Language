# Welcome to Day 1 of the 30-day Python course! Today, we will cover the basics of Python programming, including installation and setup, and writing your first Python program.

## Installation and Setup:
To begin, you will need to install Python on your computer. Python can be downloaded for free from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have installed Python, you can start writing and running Python programs using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular choices for Python IDEs include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder.

## Hello World Program:
The "Hello World" program is a classic first program for learning any programming language. It simply prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. Let's write our own "Hello World" program in Python!

Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file. Type the following code:

```
python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file as "hello_world.py". The ".py" extension indicates that this is a Python program.

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Type the following command:

```
python hello_world.py
```
This will run your Python program and print the message "Hello, World!" to the screen.

## Basic Data Types:
Python supports several basic data types, including strings, numbers, and booleans.

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. For example, "Hello, World!" is a string.

Numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (decimal numbers). For example, 42 is an integer, and 3.14 is a float.

Booleans are true/false values. They are represented by the keywords "True" and "False" (without quotes).

In Python, you can use the "type" function to determine the data type of a value. For example:

``
print(type("Hello, World!")) # output: <class 'str'>
print(type(42)) # output: <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14)) # output: <class 'float'>
print(type(True)) # output: <class 'bool'>
```
Congratulations, you have now written your first Python program and learned about some of the basic data types in Python. Stay tuned for Day 2, where we will cover variables and operators in more detail.
